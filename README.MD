### PUBG Mobile Usage

For PUBG Mobile, the tweak automatically uses a special stealth mode that:

1. Uses a CALayer-based overlay instead of UIWindow
2. Initializes after a delay to avoid anti-cheat detection
3. Updates at a lower frequency to minimize visibility to anti-cheat
4. Optionally uses the QuartzCore debug API with appropriate entitlements

You can configure the stealth level in settings:
- **Normal**: Standard hooks (not recommended)
- **Medium**: Delayed initialization with minimal hooks
- **Maximum**: Extreme caution mode with minimal footprint

Note: Changing PUBG Mobile settings requires restarting the PUBG Mobile app to take effect.

## Technical Details

FPSIndicator uses a streamlined architecture:

- **FPSCounter** - Uses CADisplayLink for accurate frame counting with statistical smoothing
- **FPSDisplay** - Provides a lightweight, draggable overlay with color coding
- **FPSPreferences** - Centralizes preference management with a single source of truth
- **FPSPUBGSupport** - Specialized handling for PUBG Mobile with anti-cheat evasion
